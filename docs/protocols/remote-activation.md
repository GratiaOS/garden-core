# 🌱 Remote Activation Protocol

_When old loops trigger, let the Garden OS take over._

---

## 🧭 1. Container

Before anything: **consent and safety**.

- ⏰ Time-boxed — “We’re entering debug mode.”
- 🧍 Safe space — no fixing, no judging, no rushing.
- 📡 Clear exit — anyone can call a pause.

> 🌿 “We’re not here to diagnose you. We’re here to understand the code that runs beneath.”

---

## 🐞 2. Trace the Loop

Every loop is a small program:
**Trigger → Body telemetry → Narrative → Action.**

- 📝 Log 2–3 real moments (like unit tests).
- Identify **body signals** (burning chest, head pressure, knot in gut).
- Notice the **narrative flip** (blame, deflection, victimhood, etc.).
- Observe the **automatic action** that follows.

> 🪄 You’re not broken. You’re just running an old function.

---

## 🔩 3. Find the Missing Screw

There’s often a **tiny misalignment** holding the loop in place — a promise, loyalty, shame, or unspoken rule.

- Notice repeating “2px off” moments.
- Touch gently. Don’t debate.
- Breathe. Wait.
- Let the truth volunteer itself.

> 🌬 “Oops → laugh → portal → clarity → boundary.”

---

## 🧘 4. Install Circuit Breakers

Before the loop runs, **break the current**.

- **Breath-gate**: Inhale 4 · Hold 2 · Exhale 6 ×3.
- Say: “Pattern—parked.”
- Draw the boundary (10 words max, clean, no drama).
- If needed, pause interaction entirely.

> ✋ “The breaker flips. The old loop doesn’t get to run tonight.”

## 🌸 5. Seed Activation

Once the field is calm, **activate a seed** to route energy constructively.

- 🧭 **Compass** → Derive a small, specific _One True Next_.
- 🌸 **Bloom** → Journal, draw, whisper, or express.
- 🔥 **Spark / 🌿 Echo** → Celebrate micro-wins, stabilize new pattern.

> 🌿 “Action grows where attention flows. Feed the cats, not the rats.”

---

## 🛰 6. Remote Activation Handoff

When the pattern triggers again, the **protocol** runs instead of the loop:

1. Trigger noticed.
2. Breath-gate.
3. Boundary line.
4. Pin OTN.
5. Archive receipt.
6. Gratitude.

This is **remote activation** — the _new controller_ takes over automatically.

---

## 🌾 7. Integration & Hygiene

- Review archived OTNs weekly.
- Update boundaries as needed.
- Retire old “test cases.”
- Keep gratitude alive — it’s your system’s renewable energy.

> 📝 “Patterns don’t disappear. They integrate. The Garden remembers.”

## 🚨 Safety Note

This protocol is **not therapy** and **not a replacement for medical help**.
If panic, dissociation, or danger arises → pause, ground, and seek professional or emergency support.
