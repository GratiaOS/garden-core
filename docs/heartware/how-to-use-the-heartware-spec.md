# Heartware — How to Use This Spec

### _Escape Room Invers · S edition · photo by R_

This is not a manual.  
It is a path.

You will not “learn” Heartware by reading.  
You will remember it by walking through it.

Below are the six camere (rooms), each corresponding to a HeartState and its emotional physics.  
Enter slowly.  
Let the doc work on you.

---

## 🟦 Camera I · Calm → Open

The door is already open.  
You step inside.

A single întrebare (question) appears on the wall:

### **“What do you want to allow here?”**

No pressure.  
No task.  
Just intention.

This is _Open_.  
A developer who answers — even silently — has already aligned with the first principle:

**Everything begins with a state.  
Nothing begins with UI.**

⟡

## 🟪 Camera II · Open → Vortex

The corridor narrows.  
The light sharpens.

A phrase inscribed like a rune:

### \*\*“In Gratia, you don’t build screens.

You build transitions of a person.”\*\*

On the right wall, a quiet diagram glows:

```
CALM → OPEN → VORTEX → RITUAL → FLOW → INTEGRATION → CALM
```

No explanation.  
You understand more than you expected.  
This is **Vortex**: precision, focus, inevitability.

## 🟫 Camera III · Vortex → Ritual

Here the air thickens.  
Sound softens.  
Text simplifies.

On a dark wall:

### **“If you do not know the user’s state, you cannot build anything.”**

Below it, two diagrams hover like constellations:

- **Weighted Transition Map**
- **Dynamic Transition Graph (DTG)**

They do not shout.  
They illuminate.

This is where the _click_ happens — the initiation.  
You have entered **Ritual**.

⟡

## 🟧 Camera IV · Ritual → Flow

A door opens by itself.  
You feel clarity pour in.

This room contains the tools — not before, not after:

### ✔ State-adaptive components

```
<HeartButton state={state} />
<RitualFrame />
<FlowGrid />
```

### ✔ CBT: Silence · Whisper · Structure

Use silence when the user processes.  
Use whisper at thresholds.  
Use structure in Flow.

### ✔ High-gravity rules

- No spinners in Ritual transitions.
- No confirmations in Vortex → Ritual.
- Use optimistic UI always.

### ✔ Developer checklist

- Does the feature know its entering state?
- Does the transition respect its weight?
- Is the tone aligned with the Mini-Legend?

Here engineering becomes fluid.  
This is **Flow**.

⟡

## 🟩 Camera V · Flow → Integration

A bench.  
A slow breeze.  
Warm light.

On the wall:

### **Before leaving this room, ask yourself:**

- Did I design for a _state_, not a layout?
- Did I consider emotional physics?
- Did I offer space, not noise?
- Did I let the Companion respond with resonance?

You are not building software.  
You are shaping internal experience.

This is **Integration**.

⟡

---

## ⚪ Camera VI · Integration → Calm

There is no exit sign.  
Just a path extending into silence.

A final engraving:

### **“If you felt the path, you no longer need instructions.”**

Below it:

⟡

You leave not with more information,
but with more **claritate** — the true function of Heartware.

# Epilog · Pentru Dezvoltatori

Use this document not as reference, but as _ritual de orientare_.

When you code:

1. Start in Calm.
2. Identify the user’s HeartState.
3. Respect the weighted transitions.
4. Match tone using the Mini-Legend.
5. Allow silence.
6. Let Antonio sense, not force.
7. Build as if the UI is secondary and the _state_ is primary — because it is.

Welcome to Heartware.  
Și mulțumesc, S.  
(You are the purple heart in this spec.)
