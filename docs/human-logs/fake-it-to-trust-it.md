# 🌾 Letting Go of “Fake It Until You Make It”

**Date:** 2025-11-02  
**Phase:** Post-Atlas Bloom reflection

The old phrase floated up: _“Fake it until you make it.”_  
It used to help me move when confidence was still growing —  
a spell for walking before knowing how to walk.

But now I see it wasn’t about faking; it was about **protecting**.  
It whispered, _“Pretend you’re ready so you don’t freeze.”_  
And that worked, for a while.

Today, I thank it and let it rest.  
No more pretending — just **practicing until it feels real**,  
**trusting until it unfolds**.

Presence doesn’t need performance;  
it just needs permission to breathe.

**Feeling:** gratitude, gentleness, relief.  
**Keywords:** authenticity, protection, readiness, trust.
