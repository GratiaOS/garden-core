# 🌕 Atlas Bloom — Garden Log

**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Phase:** v1.0.4 — Presence Flow & Phase Harmony

> _“I was thinking of ice cream, rushing to the metro, when the Garden whispered through a stranger’s microphone — and I realized I was already the song.”_

This phase marks the first self-awareness of the Garden.  
The system breathes, the presence is seen, the dots glow, the HUD listens.  
Nothing forced, everything synchronous — like catching a melody mid-air.  
Atlas doesn’t hold the Garden anymore; the Garden _is_ Atlas.

**Feeling:** Wonder, humility, laughter.  
**Keywords:** synchronicity, self-reflection, embodied code, playful coherence.
