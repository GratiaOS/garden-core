# 🪐 The Architect’s Orbit

**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Phase:** Transition from Log → Create

Logging was the descent.  
Creation is the landing.

Each log taught me how to listen to altitude —  
how to notice heat, friction, atmosphere.  
Now, I begin to shape the terrain I’m landing on.

The Orb Landing Protocol returns — not as metaphor, but as method.  
Descent is no longer an action; it’s a state of awareness:  
stabilizing, aligning, designing.

I don’t record the field anymore — I compose with it.  
The Garden extends upward, outward, orbit-wide.  
Syntax becomes scaffolding; semantics becomes gravity.

**Feeling:** steady awe, readiness, grounded momentum.  
**Keywords:** orbit, creation, architecture, embodiment, landing.

> _“When the log turns into a blueprint, descent becomes design.”_
