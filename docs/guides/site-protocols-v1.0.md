# Site Protocols v1.0 — Handling Real Locations in the Garden

_This document describes how we name, reference, and protect real places (sites) in Garden work — especially when they are inhabited by humans, animals, and long-term stories._

It exists so we don’t accidentally expose a living field (village, valley, house, land) to unwanted attention just because we like to write and share.

---

## 1. Definitions

**Site**  
A real physical place that carries ongoing Garden relevance.  
Examples: a mountain village, a house that acts as a node, a piece of land with animals and humans in steady relationship.

**Site Node**  
A site that is actively part of the Garden network (people are living/working there with awareness, not just passing through).

**Public Name**  
The name we use in public docs, repos, talks. It’s usually **generic-but-poetic**, not the legal or map name.

**Local Name**  
The real name (village, address, toponym) known to the people who live there.

---

## 2. Why This Matters

Real places are:

- fragile (weather, owners, economics)
- inhabited (humans, animals, plants, ancestors)
- slow to heal when disturbed

Publishing details about a site:

- changes how people see it
- attracts attention (mental, emotional, physical)
- can disturb animals and local rhythms
- can create pressure on the humans holding the field there

So we use a **gentle protocol** before we put any site into public stories.

---

## 3. Naming Rules

### 3.1 Public vs Local

- In **public docs**, we use a **Site Node name**, not the real village or address.  
  Example:

  - Local: (real village name)
  - Public: `The Quiet Valley Node`

- In **private notes**, we can reference the local name if needed, but only where access is already trusted.

### 3.2 How to Choose a Site Node Name

A good Site Node name is:

- evocative, but not traceable (no exact toponyms)
- rooted in the felt sense (animals, landscape, light)
- easy to remember and reuse in docs

Examples:

- `The Quiet Valley Node`
- `Four Foxes Ridge`
- `Sunridge House`
- `Riverbend Node`

Avoid:

- exact village names
- street names
- any name that makes it trivial to geo-locate in one search

---

## 4. Publication Protocol

Before putting a site into **public documentation**, check:

1. **Residents**

   - Are the humans living there aware that the place holds a special role?
   - Are they emotionally resourced enough for more attention (even if it’s subtle)?

2. **Animals / Field**

   - Does the animal presence feel stable (routine, patterns, no panic)?
   - Does the land feel like it’s still integrating something big (recent trauma, heavy shifts)?

3. **Consent in Field Terms**

   - Does it feel like the site says “yes, I want to be seen” or “not yet”?
   - If the answer is fuzzy, default to **not yet**.

4. **Scope**
   - Are we referencing the site as:
     - a metaphor (example in a doc)?
     - a case study (with some details)?
     - a call to visit (inviting people physically)?
   - The more concrete the call, the higher the bar for consent and readiness.

## 5. Levels of Exposure

We use three rough levels:

### Level 1 — Symbolic Reference

- Site appears as a **named node** only:  
  “The Quiet Valley Node is an example of a Ground + Consciousness Field site.”

- No travel instructions, no owners, no neighbors mentioned.
- Safe for almost all living sites.

### Level 2 — Case Study (Soft Edges)

- Site appears with **light context**:

  - type of landscape (mountain / coast / forest)
  - general region (e.g. “northern Spain”, “island village”)
  - high-level story (e.g. “summer refuge turned long-term node”)

- Still **no exact village name**, no photos that trivially reveal the place.

- Only do this when:
  - residents are emotionally onboard
  - the field feels stable
  - the story really helps others

### Level 3 — Invitation / Access

- Site is shared with enough detail that people could:

  - visit
  - book
  - move
  - join events

- This is **a separate decision**, outside of dev/docs.  
  It requires:
  - explicit human consent from residents
  - clear boundaries (who, when, how)
  - logistics (capacity, safety, resources)

For Garden Core **open-source docs**, we stay at **Level 1** by default.

## 6. Energetic Hygiene

When working with real sites:

- Don’t over-document fresh or fragile experiences.
- Let integration happen in humans and animals first.
- Share the **essence**, not the coordinates.
- Where possible, mix details between stories to anonymize exact locations.

For example:

- Instead of “this specific village 30km from Barcelona”, say  
  “a small mountain village, mostly empty in winter, inhabited by foxes and a handful of humans.”

The purpose is not secrecy for its own sake, but **protection of living fields while they heal and reconfigure**.

---

## 7. Example: The Quiet Valley Node

In Garden docs:

- We call the site: **The Quiet Valley Node**
- We reference:
  - foxes as co-residents
  - cats as part of CatsTown
  - a small cluster of houses on a ridge
  - the feeling of “portal, not rental”

We do **not** reference:

- the legal village name
- the owner’s full identity
- exact routes, roads, or coordinates

If the day comes when The Quiet Valley Node becomes a **public event space**, Site Protocols will be updated with a clear path for doing that safely.

## 8. Versioning

- **Site Protocols v1.0** — first public definition.
- Future versions may:
  - add templates for case studies
  - define roles (Site Stewards, Custodians)
  - include more examples of naming and exposure levels.

Until then, the simple rule stands:

> _We protect living fields first.  
>  Stories serve the places, not the other way around._
