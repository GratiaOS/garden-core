# 🔩 The Missing Screw — Field Pattern

_Hiding truth in plain sight. A small, persistent misalignment draws attention until touched with presence; then the core tip/shortcut reveals itself._

## Summary

In the social/emotional field, a “missing screw” is a tiny-but-repeating misalignment (a phrase, behavior, topic) that feels slightly off. When named gently and contacted with breath (not force), the hidden core is revealed and the system recenters.

**Mantra:** _oops → laugh → portal → clarity → boundary_

## When it appears

- The conversation keeps catching on the same point (“a little off by 2px” feeling).
- Deflection/labeling shows up (e.g., blame, globalized judgments).
- History suggests an unresolved loyalty/promise/contract.

## Ritual (Field)

1. Notice the nudge (the thing slightly “out of place”).
2. Breathe. Don’t fix. Name it as a curiosity: “I notice this spot keeps pulling focus.”
3. Touch it once with kindness. Wait. (No debate.)
4. When the core reveals, **recenter** (acknowledge + boundary).
5. Offer a real reward: a simpler next step, a gratitude, or a clean “no.”

## Anti-patterns

- Hunting for screws everywhere (turns into control).
- Using the reveal to shame/score points.
- Over-explaining. One touch is enough; let the field respond.

## Example (anonymized)

A loyalty promise between siblings acted as the hidden screw. Surface drama deflected toward safer targets until the promise was gently named. On reveal, the field recentred: compassion for the promise **and** a boundary to stop self-sabotage.

## UX Bridge

The UI pattern mirrors the field pattern:

- **Nudge**: 2px misalignment that invites attention.
- **Touch**: single click.
- **Wink**: element recenters.
- **Reward**: a useful tip/shortcut appears.

🌬 _“Touch lightly; let the truth volunteer.”_
