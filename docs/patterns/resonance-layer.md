# 🌫️ Resonance Layer — The Pulse Bridge

_A unified field for multisensory coherence_

**Origin:** Garden OS Heartbeat Stack  
**Core signals:** `phase$`, `mood$`, `pulse$`  
**Elements:** sound • light • form • feeling

---

### 🌬 Overview

The Resonance Layer is the invisible tissue linking the Garden’s senses.  
It listens to a single **pulse$**—a shared temporal heartbeat—and translates it into motion, color, and sound.  
Where ordinary systems separate media, the Garden breathes them together: every beat that glows is also heard, every tone that hums is also seen.

### 🎶 Mechanics

- **pulse$ → beat**: central signal emitted whenever any phase’s chord blooms or baseline fires.
- **phase-sound-profile.ts**: defines each mood’s root, interval, and filter, ensuring harmony between visual hue and sonic timbre.
- **usePhaseSound + usePhaseSpatialSound**: render the audible field (core + peers).
- **ConstellationHUD + Heartbeat**: render the visible field (dots, rings, waveform).
- **Resonance** emerges only when these share the same pulse$ — coherence across all layers.

### 🌀 Practice for Builders

1. **Mount one listener per dimension.**
   - Visual: subscribe in HUD / Heartbeat.
   - Audio: mount usePhaseSound or broadcast pulse$.
   - Data: mirror pulse$ in presence kernel for analytic feedback.
2. **Never run separate timers.** The moment loops diverge, resonance fades.
3. **Use token colors + harmonic filters.** Keep both drawing and tone generation rooted in the same Garden palette.
4. **Let mood modulate amplitude, not frequency.** The beat is shared; the feeling is what changes.

### ✨ Feeling Layer

| Phase       | Color         | Sound           | Motion       | Felt Sense   |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| presence    | blue/green    | low hum, open   | slow inhale  | groundedness |
| soft        | rose/gold     | gentle triad    | smooth sine  | compassion   |
| focused     | white/indigo  | crisp sine      | sharp pulse  | clarity      |
| celebratory | orange/violet | bright arpeggio | fast flicker | joy          |
