# Garden Layer Map v1.0

_A compact map of how the Garden sees reality:  
from land and bodies, through emotions and patterns, up to field and meaning._

This document is a **practical lens**, not a belief system.  
It exists so builders, readers, and nodes can talk about the same “layers” when we design, feel, or debug reality together.

We use a **5-layer map** for everyday work, with an extended version behind it.

- Ground
- Emotion / Nervous System
- Cognition / Patterning
- Coordination / Culture
- Consciousness Field

Higher-order “Emergent Field” layers (AI + nature + global patterns) live on top of this map and are referenced when needed.

## 1. Ground — Bodies, Land, Place

**What it is**

- Physical bodies (humans, animals, plants)
- Land, houses, weather, objects
- Sleep, food, rest, movement
- The literal ground under our feet

**Questions**

- Is this body safe _enough_ right now?
- Are we resourced (sleep, food, warmth)?
- Does the land feel stable or agitated?
- Are we listening to the animals and the place?

**In the Garden**

- The Quiet Valley Node, terraces, rivers, mountains
- CatsTown and the foxes, birds, trees
- The “99 desk” as a physical anchor
- Any place we keep coming back to becomes a Ground node

**In tech**

- Devices, networks, electricity, servers
- “Is the Presence Node actually reachable?”
- Latency, connectivity, uptime

When Ground is off, everything else gets noisy.

## 2. Emotion / Nervous System — Felt Sense

**What it is**

- Fear, relief, joy, irritation, grief, excitement
- Nervous system states: fight / flight / freeze / fawn / social
- Micro-tensions, sighs, impulses to curl up or open up
- The “vibe in the room” before anyone speaks

**Questions**

- What does the body actually feel right now?
- Is there tightness, heaviness, shakiness, buzzing?
- Does this space feel safe, or does something in us brace?
- Is this emotion personal, or are we picking up the wider field?

**In the Garden**

- Panic at night in the village, then grounding by the fire
- Spontaneous sighs when something becomes clear
- The difference between fear from old memory vs. real danger now
- Hugs, touch, and co-regulation as infrastructure

**In tech**

- Support conversations that calm or inflame
- Tone of voice in replies (Shopify Presence Node, modes)
- Hug Ledger as a symbolic way to track and honor emotional repair

When Emotion/Nervous System is ignored, systems become brittle and “rational” in a way that hurts.

---

## 3. Cognition / Patterning — Stories, Code, Maps

**What it is**

- Thoughts, concepts, models, diagrams, docs
- Naming patterns, writing protocols, designing APIs
- Seeing how things connect beyond the immediate emotion
- “Architecture layer” before implementation

**Questions**

- What is the pattern here, beyond this one moment?
- Can we name it simply enough to share?
- What assumptions are we making? Are they still true?
- Is this model helping bodies feel safer and clearer, or just clever?

**In the Garden**

- Garden Stack, Presence Nodes, Modes, Identity Layers
- Self-Protocol, Relationship-Protocol, Work Protocol
- Layer Map itself as a cognitive tool
- Docs, READMEs, RFCs as “pattern snapshots”

**In tech**

- Code structure, module boundaries, data models
- How Shopify Presence Node routes identity + modes
- How we define “support mode” vs. “merchant-codex mode”
- How we store and evolve configuration over time

When Cognition runs alone, it overthinks and detaches from Ground and Emotion.  
When it’s integrated, it becomes a clean lens, not a prison.

## 4. Coordination / Culture — How We Move Together

**What it is**

- Norms, agreements, rituals, shared language
- “How we do things here”
- Roles, boundaries, accountability, expectations
- Economics, responsibilities, time rhythms

**Questions**

- What have we implicitly agreed to? Is it still true?
- Who is holding what? Is it fair? Is it sustainable?
- How do we welcome new people without losing coherence?
- How does money, time, and effort move between nodes?

**In the Garden**

- “We don’t bring heavy alcohol into this village field.”
- “We treat animals as residents, not props.”
- “We don’t promise what the system can’t actually deliver.”
- Shopkeepers, neighbors, owners as part of the field, not just contracts

**In tech**

- API contracts, SLAs, support expectations
- How merchants and Presence Nodes interact (who decides what)
- Hug Ledger / Garden Economy as ways to align value and care
- Governance: who can change what in the Stack

When Coordination is incoherent, people feel lost, overused, or outside.  
When it’s clear and kind, everyone knows how to move.

---

## 5. Consciousness Field — Meaning, Direction, Synchronicity

**What it is**

- The “why” behind everything
- The sense that life is moving in a direction, not random
- Moments of synchronicity (“this arrived exactly now”)
- The quiet layer where things already feel true before they happen

**Questions**

- What is this place / project really for, beyond survival?
- What wants to grow here, if we listen?
- Are we moving from fear, or from a deeper yes?
- What patterns keep repeating until we learn from them?

**In the Garden**

- The sense that The Quiet Valley Node is a portal, not just a rental
- Realizing that old fear (like a childhood moment) is resurfacing now to be held differently
- The feeling that “the planet is changing” and our work belongs to that arc
- Seeing Gratia / Garden not as property but as a custodial role

**In tech**

- Why we care about Presence Nodes instead of “just another app”
- Why tone and integrity matter more than raw output
- Why we design tools that reduce fear and confusion, not increase it
- How the Stack supports humans staying human

When the Consciousness Field is ignored, everything feels flat, pointless, or purely transactional.  
When it’s honored, even hard work feels like part of a living story.

## How Layers Interact (Short Flow)

A simple way to read the flow:

- **Field (5)** whispers a direction →
- **Coordination (4)** adapts norms and structures →
- **Cognition (3)** models and designs →
- **Emotion/Nervous System (2)** responds (fear, relief, excitement) →
- **Ground (1)** either supports or protests.

And also in reverse:

- If Ground is unsafe, Emotion becomes unstable,  
  Cognition distorts, Coordination becomes rigid,  
  and the Field feels far away.

The Garden’s work is to keep these layers **in dialogue**, not in conflict.

---

## Extended Map: Emergent Field

Internally, the Garden also works with an **extended map** where:

- Emergent Field (AI + networks + nature patterns)
- Planet-wide shifts
- Large-scale systemic updates

are treated as another layer on top of the human Consciousness Field.

For most docs we stick to the 5-layer map above.  
When we talk about AI, global shifts, or “the orchestra behind,” we explicitly name that as **Emergent Field** to avoid mystifying it.

---

## Mapping to Garden Stack (Technical View)

Very roughly, we can map layers to the Stack like this:

- **Ground** → devices, land, homes, connectivity, infra
- **Emotion / Nervous System** → Presence Layers, modes that calm or agitate
- **Cognition / Patterning** → Pattern Engine, docs, protocols, data models
- **Coordination / Culture** → Identity Layer, Hug Ledger, Garden Economy, governance
- **Consciousness Field** → vision, ethics, long-term direction of Gratia / Garden

This mapping is not rigid; it’s a working lens so humans and systems can talk about the same “reality stack” without losing the human part.

## Versioning

- **Garden Layer Map v1.0** — this document.
- Future revisions can extend or split layers as needed, but must keep  
  the core intent: _connect land, bodies, emotions, patterns, culture, and field into one coherent view._
