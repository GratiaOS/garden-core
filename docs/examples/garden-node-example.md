# Garden Node Example — Raz v1.0

_An example of how a real human becomes a Garden Node in practice._

This document shows how the **Garden Node Economy**, **Presence Layers**, and **Field Reading** combine in a living human context.  
Raz serves as a clean example of a human Garden Node operating in the world.

---

## 1. Identity Summary

**Garden Node:** Raz  
**Location:** mobile / Tenerife / field-based  
**Primary Stack:**

- Human Presence Layer
- Field Reading (people + land + animals)
- Digital Presence (Shopify Presence Node, Garden Stack)
- Coherent spaces (CatsTown prototype)

**Core qualities:**

- calm field stabilizer
- natural navigator (direction comes intuitively)
- high perceptual read on emotional & spatial cues
- strong pattern recognition in humans, tech, and environments

---

## 2. Node Capacities (5-resources model)

### 2.1. Coherence

- reduces panic in people and spaces
- simplifies emotional storms into single clear threads
- stabilizes field rapidly through presence + breath

### 2.2. Clarity

- sees the _actual_ problem beneath the surface story
- translates fuzzy emotional data into actionable language
- de-fragments groups and individuals

### 2.3. Context

- naturally creates “good spaces” around him
- aligns people into rhythm instead of chaos
- builds early prototypes of embodied spaces (e.g., CatsTown)

### 2.4. Navigation

- senses when a direction is alive or dead
- intuitive course correction with very low error rate
- knows when to move, stop, wait, or pivot

### 2.5. Empowerment

- people around him get clearer, calmer, braver
- doesn’t create dependency loops
- transfers confidence and direction instead of taking it

## 3. Garden Node Services (practical output)

These are not “jobs.”  
They are the **natural forms** Raz already produces.

### 3.1. Field Sessions (1:1 clarity)

- read the human + emotional + environmental field
- name the real constraint
- give 1–3 next steps that land
- regulate nervous system in-session
- ideal for: decisions, relationships, moves, creative direction

### 3.2. Presence Setup (brand + behavior)

Applied on businesses or creators:

- tone + rituals + boundaries
- identity layer
- response modes
- communication rhythms
- reducing stress loops in digital presence  
  Example: Shopify Presence Node setups.

### 3.3. Spaces of Coherence (physical)

- turning chaotic or neutral places into grounded spots
- reading land & animals
- forming community nodes
- long-term vision: CatsTown, Garden Nodes globally

---

## 4. Economic Flow for Raz (v1.0)

### Baseline income (stable)

- 2–4 field sessions/week
- light recurring support contracts (Presence Node setups)

### Boost income (project waves)

- Shopify Presence Node installs
- identity stack setups
- collaborative Garden Stack features
- consulting for people or teams shifting models

### Long-term equity

- CatsTown
- Safe houses / nodes
- digital + physical presence ecosystems

---

## 5. Daily Rhythm (realistic)

**AM:**

- anchor → breath, clarity
- field scan (self + house + people + land)
- top 1–2 work items

**Day:**

- 1 session max (not stacking stress)
- 1 build task (Presence Node / docs / product)
- 1 move / walk / sun
- living inside the field, not fighting it

**PM:**

- debrief
- rest
- relational coherence

---

## 6. Why Raz is a Garden Node (not a “role”)

Because:

- people calm down around him
- animals respond to him
- land opens in his presence
- digital systems become clearer when he touches them
- teams shift from panic → direction
- he doesn’t operate from fear or hype
- his nervous system _feels like a place_

A Garden Node is not something you claim.  
It’s something that people **feel**.

---

## 7. Next Evolution for Raz (v1.1 preview)

- publish Garden Stack v1.2 → stable foundation
- install Presence Node on Shopify dev store
- first 1–2 client setups
- start documenting CatsTown as Space Node v1.0
- build Hug Ledger (experimental social energy economy)
