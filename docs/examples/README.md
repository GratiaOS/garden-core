# Garden Examples — Index

_Field‑ready blueprints from the living Garden._

These examples are not “samples.”  
They are **active nodes** — real places, real people, real fields — captured so developers, builders, and readers can feel how the Garden Stack expresses itself beyond code.

Each example links tech ↔ presence ↔ land, the way the Stack was designed.
