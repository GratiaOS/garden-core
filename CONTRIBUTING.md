# Planting Your First Seed 🌱

Welcome, fellow gardener! We're thrilled you're here, ready to dig in and help our Garden Core bloom. Whether you're weeding out bugs, planting new features, or watering our documentation, every little touch helps this garden grow.

## Preparing Your Tools 🧰

Before you start tending, gather your tools: Git is your trusty trowel, and a cozy development environment is your sunlit patch. Make sure they’re ready to help you nurture this project.

## Fork & Clone: Taking a Sprout Home 🪴

To cultivate your own corner, fork the Garden Core repository to your GitHub garden bed. Then, bring your sapling home by cloning it locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/GratiaOS/garden-core.git
```

## Getting Your Hands Dirty 🌼

Step into the project soil by navigating to the directory. Follow the README’s guidance to plant dependencies and prepare your plot for growth.

# Tending the Garden Together 🌿

## Branch Naming: Naming Your Bloom 🪴

When you branch out, give your shoots names that tell their story — start with `feature/`, `bugfix/`, or `docs/`, like `feature/add-new-widget`. It’s like labeling your seedlings so everyone knows what’s sprouting.

## Commit Messages: Recording the Growth Rings ✨

Each commit is a ring in the tree trunk of our project’s history. Write clear, heartfelt messages that share what you’ve changed and why it matters, so future gardeners understand the growth.

## Pull Requests: Sharing Your Harvest 🌼

Once your branch has blossomed, push it to your fork and open a pull request against the `main` branch in the Garden Core bed. Offer a rich description of your harvest — the changes you’ve made and the story behind them.

## Code Review: Gentle Pruning 🌿

Our garden thrives with care. Be open to feedback and ready to prune or nurture your code so it fits beautifully with the rest of the plot.

# Growing with Care 🌱

## Formatting: Keeping the Rows Straight 🛠️

Follow the garden’s natural patterns — maintain the style and formatting conventions that keep our code patch neat and harmonious. Use any automated tools as your gardeners’ helpers.

## Testing: Watering and Weeding 🧪

Help the garden stay healthy by adding or updating tests. Think of tests as watering and weeding — they keep bugs from choking our growth.

## Documentation: Writing the Garden Journal 📝

Every new bloom deserves a note in the garden journal. Update or add documentation so others can understand and appreciate the beauty you’ve added.

# Community & Communication: Cultivating Togetherness 🌿

Garden Core flourishes when tended by many hands. If you have a wild idea, a question, or a seedling to share, open an issue or join the circle of gardeners chatting nearby. Speak kindly, listen deeply, and remember: this is a shared garden, not a factory. 🌱

# License & Attribution: Honoring Our Roots 🌱

By contributing, you agree to license your gifts under the Garden Core project’s open soil — so our garden can grow freely for all.

Thank you for planting your time and care here. Together, we’ll watch Garden Core blossom into something truly beautiful. 🌼🌿
