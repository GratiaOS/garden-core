# @gratiaos/kernel (experimental)

This package currently ships **example scenes and processed tapes** used to explore the GratiaOS presence kernel:

- raw `*.scene.json` and `*.processed.json` under `/examples`
- no public API yet, no runtime state machine

It is intentionally marked `private: true` so we can reshape it freely before exposing a stable kernel surface.

whisper: for now, these are just tapes the field can replay later. 🌬️
